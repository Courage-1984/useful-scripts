# Convert / Compress Images

### ALWAYS try to convert/compress losslessly rather than lossy

For lossless PNG optimization:

## [Oxipng](https://github.com/shssoichiro/oxipng)

> Oxipng is a multithreaded lossless PNG/APNG compression optimizer.

I recommend the following 2:

## [XnView Shell Extension](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnshell/)

> A powerful Shell extension for Windows Explorer

## [XnConvert](https://www.xnview.com/en/xnconvert/)

> The Best Bulk Image Converter

**I have had a better experience with XnView Shell Extension...**

The following one is also nice:

## [File Converter](https://github.com/Tichau/FileConverter)

> File Converter is a very simple tool which allows you to convert and compress files using the context menu in windows explorer.

**this is a very conveniant one**

### I prefer to always have my images as png but webp is also a good option, espescially regarding file size.
